 *
 * The order of link states are based on Eric Meyer's article:
 * http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/06/11/who-ordered-the-link-states
 *
 * :visited - A link that has already been visited.
 * :hover   - A link that is being hovered over.
 * :focus   - A link that has been given keyboard focus.
 * :active  - A link that is being actively clicked.
